# FindAPlayer

This is a repository based on my Final Year Project for University

Once the repository has been cloned, to start this program will be done by index.html

Before starting the program, in order to get the database function you will need to change the API keys and create a project on Firebase which will be provided in the link below:

https://console.firebase.google.com/

Alongside this, a npm package called 'http-server' will need to be installed for this project to run on a local host.
